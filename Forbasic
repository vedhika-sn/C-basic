in a week (starting from Monday to Saturday), he will be awarded Rs.200 more than the previous day as "Punctuality Incentive". The incentive I for the starting day (ie on Monday) 
is passed as the input to the program. The number of days N an employee came on time consecutively starting from Monday is also passed as the input. The program must calculate and 
print the "Punctuality Incentive" P of the employee.

Input Format: The first line denotes the value of I. The second line denotes the value of N.
